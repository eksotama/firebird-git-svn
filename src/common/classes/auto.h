// CVC: It turns out that AutoPtr was designed to deallocate single objects,
// not arrays. Worse even, we need in many places to allocate dynamically an
// array of char*/UCHAR* that's later converted into a pointer to a single
// object and passed to AutoPtr. In that case, AutoPtr will invoke the wrong
// deallocation logic and therefore we have undefined behavior, typically a leak.
// See execute_statement.cpp for an example. This is the reason this
// AutoPtrFromString beast was created.
// Alex: It should be gone after full Ñ++ code conversion
