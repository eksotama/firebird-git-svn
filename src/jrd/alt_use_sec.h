// During the build process in the initial stages the isc4.gdb database does
// not exist, but to build the isc4.gdb database the tools need to be built.
// So the following #define is set/unset in the makefile depending upon which
// stage in the compile process we are up to.
//
// In the earlier stages it is set to "1" then after we have build a set of
// tools mainly gpre_static and gbak_static it is changed to an "undef".
//
// The alt_use_sec.h file is built from alt_use_sec.h.pre using sed 
// See the Makefile.in.jrd for the two places where the .h file is built.
//
// The build is done this way to allow the makefile to have a simple set
// of dependancies to determine the makeup and up to date check for 
// libgds.a/so.
