Setup Command Line Parameters
=============================

General parameters available to all InnoSetup based installers
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Setup program accepts optional command line parameters. These can
be useful to system administrators, and to other programs calling the
Setup program.

These notes are applicable to version 4.2.7 of InnoSetup.
/SP-
  Disables the 'This will install... Do you wish to continue?' prompt at
  the beginning of Setup. Of course, this will have no effect if the
  DisableStartupPrompt [Setup] section directive was set to yes.


/SILENT, /VERYSILENT
  Instructs Setup to be silent or very silent. When Setup is silent the
  wizard and the background window are not displayed but the installation
  progress window is. When a setup is very silent this installation
  progress window is not displayed. Everything else is normal so for
  example error messages during installation are displayed and the startup
  prompt is (if you haven't disabled it with DisableStartupPrompt or the '/SP-' command line option
  explained above)

  If a restart is necessary and the '/NORESTART' command isn't used
(see below) and Setup is silent, it will display a Reboot now?
  message box. If it's very silent it will reboot without asking.


/LOG
  Causes Setup to create a log file in the user's TEMP directory
  detailing file installation actions taken during the installation
  process. This can be a helpful debugging aid. For example, if you
  suspect a file isn't being replaced when you believe it should be (or
  vice versa), the log file will tell you if the file was really
  skipped, and why.

  The log file is created with a unique name based on the current date.
  (It will not overwrite or append to existing files.) Currently, it is
  not possible to customize the filename.

  The information contained in the log file is technical in nature and
  therefore not intended to be understandable by end users. Nor is it
  designed to be machine-parseable; the format of the file is subject
  to change without notice.


/NOCANCEL
  Prevents the user from cancelling during the installation process,
  by disabling the Cancel button and ignoring clicks on the close
  button. Useful along with '/SILENT' or '/VERYSILENT'.


/NORESTART
  Instructs Setup not to reboot even if it's necessary.


/RESTARTEXITCODE=exit code
  Specifies the custom exit code that Setup is to return when a restart
  is needed. Useful along with '/NORESTART'. Also see Setup Exit Codes.


/LOADINF="filename"
  Instructs Setup to load the settings from the specified file after
  having checked the command line. This file can be prepared using the
  '/SAVEINF=' command as explained below.

  o Don't forget to use quotes if the filename contains spaces.


/SAVEINF="filename"
  Instructs Setup to save installation settings to the specified file.

  o Don't forget to use quotes if the filename contains spaces.


/LANG=language
  Specifies the language to use. language specifies the internal name
  of the language as specified in a [Languages] section entry.

  o When a valid /LANG parameter is used, the Select Language dialog will be suppressed.


/DIR="x:\dirname"
  Overrides the default directory name displayed on the Select Destination
  Location wizard page. A fully qualified pathname must be specified.


/GROUP="folder name"
  Overrides the default folder name displayed on the Select Start Menu Folder
  wizard page. If the [Setup] section directive DisableProgramGroupPage
  was set to yes, this command line parameter is ignored.


/NOICONS
  Instructs Setup to initially check the Don't create any icons check box
 on the Select Start Menu Folder wizard page.


Parameters specific to Firebird installs
----------------------------------------

/COMPONENTS="comma separated list of component names"

  Choose from - ServerComponent\SuperServerComponent,
                ServerComponent\ClassicServerComponent,
                ServerComponent,
                DevAdminComponent and
                ClientComponent

  Overrides the default components settings. Using this command line
  parameter causes Setup to automatically select a custom type. A full
  install requires combining components. For example:

  /COMPONENTS="SuperServerComponent,ServerComponent,
               DevAdminComponent,ClientComponent"

  would be required for a full install.


/FORCE

  Tells the installer to ignore its analysis of the existing
  environment. It will attempt to install and configure Firebird 1.5 as
  if no previous version of Firebird or InterBase was installed.

  This can be useful if you have a seriously broken installation that
  you cannot uninstall. Or it could be another way to aggravate your
  users by breaking a perfectly good working install of InterBase. Its
  your choice.


/NOCPL

  Don't install the Control Panel Applet. This is useful for two
  reasons:

  o Installing/Uninstalling the CPL applet requires a system
    restart on Windows 2000 (and perhaps some other platforms.)

  o You may wish to use an alternative cpl applet.


/NOGDS32

  Don't install a copy of the client library into the system directory,
  even if installation analysis concludes it is OK to do so.


/COPYFBCLIENT

  Copy the fbclient.dll to the system directory. This is recommended
  for client installs if you are sure that you will only ever be
  accessing a single server version. If your client applications are
  likely to take advantage of accessing different server versions this
  is not recommended. See
    doc/README.Win32LibraryInstallation.txt
  for more information.
