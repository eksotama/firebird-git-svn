Introduction
============

Welcome to the second beta release of Firebird 2.1


Intended Users
==============

This beta release is intended for experienced Firebird
users. It has not been thoroughly tested and new
features are only sparsely documented. Do not use this
release in a production environment.


Features in this release
========================

Please see the Release Notes for details of new
features.

Installation
============

Binary installation packages are available, but they do
not support multiple service instance installation.
Be sure to read the installation_readme.txt in the doc
directory for more information concerning installation
issues.

You can also use the zip packages to install Firebird
manually. There is more info on manual installation
in doc\install_windows_manually.txt.


Reporting Bugs
==============

Before you report a bug:

 o Check you know how Firebird works.
   Maybe it is not a bug at all.

 o Perhaps some has already reported this? Browse
   existing bug reports here:

	http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa

 o If in doubt why not discuss the problem on the
   Firebird-devel list? You can subscribe here:

	http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/firebird-devel

   and the list is viewable via a newsgroup interface
   here:

	news://news.atkin.com/


Please don't use the Firebird-devel list for technical
support unless the question specifically relates to a
new feature in Firebird 2.1


Happy Testing!

From the Firebird team.
