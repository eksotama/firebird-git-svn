Introduction
============

Welcome to Firebird 2.5.


Intended Users
==============

This is a pre-alpha version of Firebird. 

It is not intended for use. It is for 
test purposes only.


Reporting Bugs
==============

This is an experimental version. 

DO NOT REPORT A BUG IN THIS RELEASE
unless you really know what you are doing. 

Check first on the firebird-devel list.
If you don't know where the firebird-devel 
list is then you shouldn't be using this 
version of Firebird!

Please don't use the Firebird-devel list for technical
support unless the question specifically relates to a
new feature in Firebird 2.5


Happy Testing!

From the Firebird team.
