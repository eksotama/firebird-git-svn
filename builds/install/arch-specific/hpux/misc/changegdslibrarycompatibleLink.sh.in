For classic server there are two optional backward compatible client libraries.
These are libfbclient.sl and libfbembed.sl.  

libfbclient.sl) enables your client to be multithreaded but must connect to a 
                database via a server.  
libfbembed.sl)  allows the client to directly open the database file, but does
                not support multithreaded access

Your current setting is:
