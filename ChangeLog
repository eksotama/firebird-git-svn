	* firebird2/configure.in (1.44):

	Autoconf cleanup:  o since the define 'VAX' was only used to tell
	that the byte order is	  LITTLE_ENDIAN (it have nothing else to do
	with the VAX computer family)	 it can safely replaced with
	'!WORDS_BIGENDIAN'.   o check if pointers are 64 bit   o replaced
	HAS_64BIT_POINTERS with 'SIZEOF_VOID_P == 8'

2002-09-11 13:30  eku

	* firebird2/: autogen.sh (1.4), configure.in (1.43):

	Autoconf enhancements:	o autoconf v2.53 and later is now required
	to generate configure	 (sorry, but it makes many tasks easier)  o
	improved tests for mmap, socklen_t and offt_64	o added tests for
	atexit, on_exit, (v)fork, set(p)grp, setpgid and flock	o added
	test for the keyword 'volatile'  o fixed errors in configure.in  o
	updated config.h.in and autoconfig_msvc.h (the latter may be
	incorrect)  o replaced VOLATILE by volatile  o removed SETPGRP and
	ATEXIT	o replaced NO_FLOCK by HAVE_FLOCK  o SIG_FPTR cleanup  o
	vfork cleanup

	work for you, please extend the tests in configure.in, rather than
	defining this in prefix.your_system.

	function strcasecmp and stricmp  o replaced STRICMP
