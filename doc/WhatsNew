    * Changed file names.
        Renamed distribution files to make sure we're Firebird. Now they're fbserver, fbclient, firebird.msg etc.
      Note:
        The client library is fbclient now and it should be used in all new FB-based projects. gds32 contains nothing but redirected exports and is provided for compatibility only.

    * New CREATE OR ALTER statement (SF #451935).
        Allow either creating or altering a database object depending on its existance.
      Syntax:
        CREATE OR ALTER name <object_definition>;
      Notes:
        1. Applicable to SPs/triggers only.
        2. The statement has the same meaning as CREATE OR REPLACE one in Oracle.

    * New COALESCE internal function (SF #451917).
        Allow a column value to be calculated by a number of expressions, the first expression returning a non NULL value is returned as the column value.
      Syntax:
        COALESCE (value {, value} ... )
      Notes:
        1. COALESCE (V1, V2) is equivalent to the following case specification:
             CASE WHEN V1 IS NOT NULL THEN V1 ELSE V2 END
        2. COALESCE (V1, V2, ..., Vn), for n >= 3, is equivalent to the following case specification:
             CASE WHEN V1 IS NOT NULL THEN V1 ELSE COALESCE (V2, ..., Vn) END
        3. The function has the same meaning as NVL one in Oracle.
      Example:
        SELECT
          PROJ_NAME AS Projectname,
          COALESCE(e.FULL_NAME, '[> not assigned <]') AS Employeename
        FROM
          PROJECT p LEFT JOIN EMPLOYEE e ON (e.EMP_NO = p.TEAM_LEADER)

    * New NULLIF internal function (SF #451917).
        Return a NULL value for a sub-expression if it has a specific value, otherwise return the value of the sub-expression.
      Syntax:
        NULLIF (value, value)
      Note:
        NULLIF (V1, V2) is equivalent to the following case specification:
          CASE WHEN V1 = V2 THEN NULL ELSE V1 END
      Example:
        UPDATE PRODUCTS
          SET STOCK = NULLIF(STOCK, 0)

    * New CASE internal function (SF #451917).
        Allow the result of a column to be determined by a the results of a case expression.
      Syntax:
        <case_specification> = <simple_case> | <searched_case>

        <simple_case> = CASE value <simple_when_clause> ... [ELSE value] END
        <simple_when_clause> = WHEN value THEN value

        <searched_case> = CASE <searched_when_clause> ... [ELSE value] END
        <searched_when_clause> = WHEN <search_condition> THEN value
      Note:
        The function has the same meaning as DECODE one in Oracle.
      Examples:
        1. Simple case:
          SELECT
            o.ID,
            o.Description,
            CASE o.Status
              WHEN 1 THEN 'confirmed'
              WHEN 2 THEN 'in production'
              WHEN 3 THEN 'ready'
              WHEN 4 THEN 'shipped'
              ELSE 'unknown status ''' || o.Status || ''''
            END
          FROM
            Orders o
        2. Searched case:
          SELECT
            o.ID,
            o.Description,
            CASE
              WHEN (o.Status IS NULL) THEN 'new'
              WHEN (o.Status = 1) THEN 'confirmed'
              WHEN (o.Status = 3) THEN 'in production'
              WHEN (o.Status = 4) THEN 'ready'
              WHEN (o.Status = 5) THEN 'shipped'
              ELSE 'unknown status ''' || o.Status || ''''
            END
          FROM
            Orders o

          [ACTIVE | INACTIVE]
          <trigger_action_prefix>
          <trigger_action_suffix> [OR <trigger_action_suffix>] [OR <trigger_action_suffix>]
          [POSITION number]
          AS <trigger_body>
        <trigger_action_prefix> = {BEFORE | AFTER}
        <trigger_action_suffix> = {DELETE | INSERT | UPDATE}
      Example:
        CREATE TRIGGER my_trigger FOR my_table BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE
          AS BEGIN
