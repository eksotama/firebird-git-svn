Services API enhancements in Firebird v2.
-----------------------------------------

1) Services API extension for new shutdown modes.
(Alex Peshkov, peshkoff@mail.ru, 2008)

New DB shutdown modes can now be set using services. A number of new 
isc_spb_prp_* constants should be used for it.

isc_spb_prp_shutdown_mode and isc_spb_prp_online_mode are used to perform
database shutdown/online operation. They have a single byte parameter, 
setting new shutdown mode: isc_spb_prp_sm_normal, isc_spb_prp_sm_multi,
isc_spb_prp_sm_single and isc_spb_prp_sm_full. They exactly match gfix's
shutdown modes. When performing shutdown operation, you must specify
also type of shutdown: one of isc_spb_prp_force_shutdown, 
isc_spb_prp_attachments_shutdown or isc_spb_prp_transactions_shutdown. 
They have single int (4-byte) parameter, specifying timeout for desired
operation.
Please note that old-styled parameters are also supported and should be
used to enter default shutdown (currently 'multi') and online ('normal') 
modes.

Samples of use of new parameters in fbsvcmgr utility (supposing login and 
password are set using some other method):
 Shutdown database to single-user maintenance mode:
  fbsvcmgr service_mgr action_properties dbname employee prp_shutdown_mode prp_sm_single prp_force_shutdown 0
 After it enable multi-user maintenance:
  fbsvcmgr service_mgr action_properties dbname employee prp_online_mode prp_sm_multi
 After it go to full shutdown mode, disabling new attachments during 60 seconds:
  fbsvcmgr service_mgr action_properties dbname employee prp_shutdown_mode prp_sm_full prp_attachments_shutdown 60
 Return to normal state:
  fbsvcmgr service_mgr action_properties dbname employee prp_online_mode prp_sm_normal
