Cleaning todo

The order is not significative.

Macros
.- Remove NOT_USED_OR_REPLACED Macro
.- Remove PYXIS macro
.- Remove NO_CHECKSUM macro (and CCH_Checksum function in cch.cpp)
.- Remove GDS_VAL and GDS_REF macros.
.- Remove NULL_PTR macro
.- Remove TRUE and FALSE macros and replace with builtin "true" and "false"

Code
.- Remove warnings
	Comparison between signed and unsigned
	Cast from pointer to integer of different size
	Format arg and argument not matching.
.- Define (type-safe?) unions for nod_arg and lls_object. 
	Nod_arg is used in several places of the code to contain pointers to several kinds of objects or numbers, whether is defined as pointer to xxx_nod.
	The same happends with lls_object in lls (linked list) where the lls_object can store pointers or numbers, whether is defined as pointer to xxx_nod.
	See gpre.h nod_arg in gpre_nod struct and lls_object in lls struct.
.- Modify gds__msg_format and derivated functions to use arglist instead of TEXT arguments. This change will also remove a lot of casts.
.- Remove casts.

Builds
.- Posix take cpp generated from epp out of src directory.
.- Build help.fdb from script.
.- Build msg.fdb from script.
