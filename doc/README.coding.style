  Writing FB code every coder should keep in mind these rules:

- Configure your editor to use 4 position for tabstop.
- indent: 1 tab
- space after e.g. if/for/while/switch - do "if (", not "if(".
- no spaces allowed between function name and leading left paren - do
"foo()", not "foo ()".
- spaces around operation - do "c = a + b;"
- spaces between function's parameters.
- no spaces with pointer sign - do "*p++ = *q++" and "char *a".
- Mandatory braces around scoped code. Closing brace always aligned to the
first char of the keyword introducing the scope - i.e.

	if (foo) {
		// code
	}

or 

	if (foo)
	{
		//code
	}

second form is preferable.

- No spaces in C++ cast expressions. Do "static_cast<type*>(ptr)", not
"static_cast < type * > ( ptr )".
- Prefer to keep lines shorter than 80 chars.
- Prefer initialization over assignment.
- Don't break the build. Before commiting do full build cycle from
scratch (on all available platforms).
- Always end source files, including headers, with a newline.
